DSA Basics

This repository documents my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). I upload daily practice problems, notes, and solutions in PDF format as I master each concept.

Repository Structure

Files are named by the day of completion (e.g., Day1.pdf, Day2.pdf).

Each file contains well-explained solutions to reinforce conceptual clarity.

Topics Covered (To Date)

Arrays

Strings

(Upcoming topics include Searching, Sorting, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, and more as I advance.)

My Progress

As an IT final-year student, I am laying a strong foundation by focusing on fundamental DSA concepts. This repository serves as a personal log to:

Track daily practice

Identify areas for improvement

Build consistency in problem-solving

Objective

This repository supports my preparation for technical interviews and my growth toward becoming a competent software developer. I aim to expand this into a comprehensive learning resource as I progress through more complex topics.
